When we run the program, we get the Error: 'ZeroDivisionError'
which, as the name indicates, means that there is an invalid division on the program where the denominator is 0
When we debug the program (i set the first print as the breakpoint) and step into the function we see that the first print has no errors
However, when we do the same for the second print, we notice that the value t1 = g(c,d) becomes 0 as g(c,d) = c - d = 3 -3 = 0
So, on the next step of the 'f' function the division is not obtainable and we obtain the error
